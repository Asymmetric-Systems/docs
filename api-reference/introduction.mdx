## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://rkdune--symmetry.modal.run
```

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication using a Bearer token. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ASYMMETRIC_API_KEY
```

You can get an API key from the [Dashboard](https://asymmetric.sh/billing).

## OpenAI SDK Compatibility

The `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint is compatible with the OpenAI SDK. Simply configure the client with our base URL:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://rkdune--symmetry.modal.run/v1/",
    api_key="YOUR_ASYMMETRIC_API_KEY",
)
```

## Features

Asymmetric provides several features that extend standard chat completions:

- **Nightly**: Give your agents persistent memory across interactions
- **Policies**: Add custom guardrails to filter outputs in real-time
- **Adaption**: Automatically finetune models based on agent interactions (Beta)

## Rate Limits

API requests are subject to rate limits based on your plan. Contact support if you need higher limits.
