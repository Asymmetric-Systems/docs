description: 'Give your agents memory with Nightly'
---

Nightly lets your agents learn and improve over time by autonomously and asynchronously deciding what interactions are worth remembering, and then efficiently accessing those memories at inference time.

The `memory_group` is a unique key for a persistent pool of memories (e.g., one per user or per agent type). The `user_goal` is a hint you can provide to help your agent better curate which interactions are worth saving as memories.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://rkdune--symmetry.modal.run/v1/",
    api_key="YOUR_ASYMMETRIC_API_KEY",  # get an API key from the dashboard
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",  # use any model
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the Sylow theorems."}],
    stream=False,
    extra_body={
        "nightly": ["my_math_agent", "This agent helps prove theorems in abstract algebra."]
        #            ^ memory_group      ^ user_goal
    }
)
```
